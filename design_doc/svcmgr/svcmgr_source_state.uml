title Life cycle of a Source on the Service Manager and Scanner

SourceInSVCMGR: Source status is dominant by svcmgr, \n after scanner action request from other services, \n before scan job leave job scheduler

[*] -> SourceInSVCMGR
state SourceInSVCMGR {
  SourceNew: New source generated
  SourceInJobMap: Source stay in the job scheduler
  SourceConnTestFailed: Connection test boardcast failed on this source for all scanners

  [*] --> SourceNew: DoSaveSource
  SourceNew --> SourceInJobMap: DoConnectionTest, JobMap.InsertJob
  SourceNew --> SourceConnTestFailed: DoConnectionTest
  SourceInJobMap --> [*]
}

SourceInScanner: Source status is dominant by scanner, when source is not owned by svcmgr

SourceInSVCMGR --> SourceInScanner: JobMap.RunJob
state SourceInScanner {
  SourceAssigned: Source assigned to scanner
  SourceAssignFailed: Source failed to assign to scanner
  SourceScanning: Source is being scanned
  SourceScanned: Source has been scanned
  SourceScanFailed: Source scan failed

  [*] --> SourceAssigned: ScannerAction.AddSource
  [*] --> SourceAssignFailed: ScannerAction.AddSource
  [*] --> SourceScanning: ScannerAction.OnDemandFullScan
  [*] --> SourceScanned: ScannerAction.OnDemandFullScan
  SourceAssigned --> SourceScanning: ScannerAction.OnDemandScan
  SourceScanning --> SourceScanned: GetScanSource
  SourceScanning --> SourceScanFailed: GetScanSource, ScannerAction.StopScan
  SourceScanned --> SourceScanning: ScannerAction.OnDemandFullScan
  SourceAssignFailed --> [*]
  SourceScanned --> [*]
  SourceScanFailed --> [*]
  SourceConnTestFailed --> [*]
}

SourceInScanner --> [*] : ScannerAction.DeleteSource
